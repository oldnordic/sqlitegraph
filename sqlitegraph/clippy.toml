# Clippy configuration for SQLiteGraph
#
# This configuration tunes clippy for SQLiteGraph's architecture:
# - Library + CLI split causes cross-target dead_code false positives
# - Benchmark utilities trigger complexity warnings
# - DSL parsing and CLI commands create similar naming patterns
# - Dual runtime harness creates complex generic types
#
# IMPORTANT: dead_code is intentionally NOT silenced - these are
# documented false positives from cross-target usage patterns.

# MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)
msrv = "1.70.0"

# Cognitive complexity - allow for complex graph algorithms and SQL statements
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 30

# Type complexity - allow for dual runtime harness generics
type-complexity-threshold = 300

# Too many arguments - CLI commands and pattern engine functions legitimately need many
too-many-arguments-threshold = 12

# Too many lines - SQL statements and complex graph operations exceed default
too-many-lines-threshold = 150

# Specific lint configurations
# Note: Most lint suppressions should be handled via #[allow] attributes in code
# rather than global configuration to keep the configuration maintainable
